# Step 1: Make it
##What is it?
Lighting up my micro:bit with love by showing a heart.

These two videos show you what you'll make and how to code it:

##How it works

- When the program is transferred (flashed) to your micro:bit, the processor steps through the instructions you gave it.
  
- The program shows a heart picture on the micro:bit’s LED display output.
  
- The heart stays on the display as long as it has power because you haven’t given it any further instructions to show anything else.
  
- The micro:bit has a set of other built-in images you can use in your projects.

- Pictures on computers, phones and tablet screens are made using dots called ‘pixels’. The micro:bit’s display has 25 LED pixels arranged in a 5 x 5 grid.



## What you need

- micro:bit (or MakeCode simulator)
- MakeCode or Python editor
- USB cable if using a computer
- battery pack (if using a phone or tablet).
- Set-up guide

# Step 2: Code it
MakeCode: See Microbit-heart.hex file
Python: See Microbit-heart.py file 

# Step 3: Improve it
- Try choosing other built-in pictures like HAPPY, DUCK or GHOST.
- Show more than one image?
- See if you can make your own pictures by exploring the other projects.
