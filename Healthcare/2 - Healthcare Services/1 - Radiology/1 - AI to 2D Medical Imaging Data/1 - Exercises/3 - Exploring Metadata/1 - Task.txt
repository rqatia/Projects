I was given a dataframe that describes a large dataset.
My goal is to perform a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
on the population in the dataset provided such that I
will be able to answer the following questions:


- How are the different diseases distributed in the dataset in terms of frequency and co-occurrence with one another? (choosing one of the diseases and assess its co-occurrence frequencies with all other diseases.)
- How is age distributed across the dataset? Is it distributed differently for different diseases?
- How is sex distributed across the dataset? Is it distributed differently for different diseases?
- For findings that have a Mass_size (i.e. not just a binary classification of disease presence) is there a relationship between size and age, sex, or presence of other diseases?
