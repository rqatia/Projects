> Summary 

Ebola viruses are responsible for causing Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans and other primates. This viral disease is also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) and has affected thousands of people across the world, particularly in Africa. The reason for Africa being the most affected region is attributed to its proximity to wild animals such as bats and primates. During the 2014 – 2016 epidemic outbreak in Africa “Next-generation sequencing” data was leveraged to trace the epidemic.

 In this project, the following was used:
 - Next-generation sequencing to monitor pandemics;
 - Bioinformatic approaches to analyse genomic sequences; 
 - Viruses in patients’ samples through the identification of significant variants to determine the relationship between viruses; and
 - Shared origins of viral genomes (phylogenetic analysis) to identify a connection between genomic variation and disease phenotype. 
 
Epidemiological data of microbial genomes of the recent Ebola virus was used to confirm data reliability and practice real world examples.
